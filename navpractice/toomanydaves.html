    	<p>Too Many Daves</p>
		<p>by Dr. Seuss</p>
		<p>Did I ever tell you that Mrs. McCave<br>
		Had twenty-three sons and she named them all Dave?<br>
		Well, she did. And that wasn't a smart thing to do.<br>
		You see, when she wants one and calls out, "Yoo-Hoo!<br>
		Come into the house, Dave!" she doesn't get one.<br>
		All twenty-three Daves of hers come on the run!<br>
		This makes things quite difficult at the McCaves'<br>
		As you can imagine, with so many Daves.<br>
		And often she wishes that, when they were born,<br>
		She had named one of them Bodkin Van Horn<br>
		And one of them Hoos-Foos. And one of them Snimm.<br>
		And one of them Hot-Shot. And one Sunny Jim.<br>
		And one of them Shadrack. And one of them Blinkey.<br>
		And one of them Stuffy. And one of them Stinkey.<br>
		Another one Putt-Putt. Another one Moon Face.<br>
		Another one Marvin O'Gravel Balloon Face.<br>
		And one of them Ziggy. And one Soggy Muff.<br>
		One Buffalo Bill. And one Biffalo Buff.<br>
		And one of them Sneepy. And one Weepy Weed.<br>
		And one Paris Garters. And one Harris Tweed.<br>
		And one of them Sir Michael Carmichael Zutt<br>
		And one of them Oliver Boliver Butt<br>
		And one of them Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate ...<br>
		But she didn't do it. And now it's too late.</p>
