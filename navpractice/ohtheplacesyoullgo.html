     	<p>Oh, The Places You'll Go!</p>
		<p>by Dr. Seuss</p>
		<p>You have brains in your head.<br>
		You have feet in your shoes.<br>
		You can steer yourself<br>
		Any direction you choose.<br>
		You’re on your own. And<br>
		you know what you know.<br>
		And YOU are the guy who’ll<br>
		decide where to go.</p>

		<p>You’ll get mixed up,<br>
		of course, as you already know.<br>
		You’ll get mixed up with<br>
		many strange birds as you go.<br>
		So be sure when you step.<br>
		Step with care and great<br>
		tact and remember that<br>
		Life’s A Great Balancing Act.</p>

		<p>And will you succeed?<br>
		Yes! You will, indeed!<br>
		(98 and ¾ percent guaranteed.)</p>

		<p>KID, YOU’LL MOVE<br>
		MOUNTAINS!</p>
