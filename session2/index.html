<i>Tempranillo is a black grape variety widely grown to make full-bodied red wines in its native Spain.</i> Its name is the diminutive of the Spanish <b>temprano ("early")</b>, a reference to the fact that it ripens several weeks earlier than most Spanish red grapes. Tempranillo has been grown on the Iberian Peninsula since the time of Phoenician settlements. It is the main grape used in Rioja, and is often referred to as Spain's noble grape. The grape has been planted throughout the globe's wine regions. In 2015, Tempranillo was the fourth most widely planted wine grape variety worldwide with 232,561 hectares (574,670 acres) under vine, of which 87% was in Spain where it is the most planted red grape variety.</p>

<p>Unlike more aromatic red wine varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Pinot noir, Tempranillo has a <b>relatively neutral profile</b> so it is often blended with other varieties, such as Grenache and Carignan (known in Rioja as Mazuelo), or aged for extended periods in oak where the wine easily takes on the flavor of the barrel. Varietal examples of Tempranillo usually exhibit flavors of <b>plum and strawberries.</b></p>

<p>Tempranillo is an early ripening variety that tends to thrive in chalky vineyard soils such as those of the <b>Ribera del Duero region of Spain</b>. In Portugal, where the grape is known as Tinto Roriz and Aragonez, it is blended with others to produce port wine.</p>

<p>Spain grows <b>87% of the world's Tempranillo</b>, and it is Spain's most planted red grape variety with 201,051 hectares (496,810 acres) grown in 2015, accounting for 42% of the red grape plantings, surpassed only by the white grape variety Airén. Tempranillo is native to northern Spain and widely cultivated as far south as Andalusia. <b>The two major regions that grow Tempranillo are Rioja, in north central Spain, and Ribera del Duero, which lies a little farther to the south.</b> Substantial quantities are also grown in the Penedès, Navarra and Valdepeñas regions.</p>
